description: Run the persona workbook activity matrix pipeline
---

When asked to run the Exercise Physiology "Current vs. Future State" analysis:

- Confirm the user has provided the Client Workbook `.xlsx` (persona database).
- Use the repo's default reference inputs from `configs/default.yaml`:
  - Limits matrix: `Exercise limits optimised.xlsx`
  - Classifications matrix: `Exercise Threshold Classifications.xlsx`
  - Logic rules: `Activities Threshold Logic Matrix.docx`
- Execute:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m src.pipeline.cli --clients "<CLIENT_WORKBOOK.xlsx>" -o out -v
```

- Output report: `out/persona_activity_report.xlsx` (one sheet per client).
